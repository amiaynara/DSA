Technical Part
--------------
This all starts because we want a "GOOD CODE". Wait what is a "good code"?
- Readability
- Scalability 
    - Time Complexity 
    - Space Complexity
A good engineer must know to strike a balance between all the three parameters. And he/she decides it
based on the company(startup), requirements and all other factors that may play a role.
