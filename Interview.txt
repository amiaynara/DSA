Getting an Interview
--------------------
If you are looking for job, you have to go through Interviews. To get the interview, you
have to get the empolyers to notice you. To do that you have to start to apply for companies. 
Do not wait, just apply. If you get selected for a job Offer that you don't like. You can always
politely deny the offer. This will prepare for the actual interviews. I realise that I have not
been in many interviews. So I have to start applying, instead of whining.

 I know my boundaries; always ready to expand them as and when needed.

Hey $BOB,
I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular

I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
or $ROLE. Iâ€™d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
